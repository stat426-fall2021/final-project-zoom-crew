## Capstone Project Approval

Please submit a proposal and outline of your project in pdf or Word format.  Your proposal should include:  
  
1.  What research question are you trying to answer  
  
*We want to predict the metascore of a movie based on features such as budget, revenue, actor name, director name, and more.*  
  
2.  What data are you planning on using and where are you going to get the data?  
  
*We plan on using the “IMDb movies extensive dataset” from Kaggle.*  

3.  How much data wrangling or cleaning will be required.  Are you planning on making new features?  
  
*We will need to figure out a way to categorize actors and genres, as those features are currently condensed into their own columns. Other than that, the Kaggle rating of the dataset’s “usability” is 10.0, so we plan on devoting more attention to analysis of the data.*  
  
4.  What types of EDA are you planning on doing?  
  
*We will perform principal component analysis and visualize the data using a multivariate chart in order to determine how each variable contributes to the target (film metascore). We plan to use all visualization methods at our disposal to get a good understanding of the state of the data.*  
  
5.  What kind of machine learning model will you most likely use?  
  
*We will be using supervised machine learning models for this analysis. We plan to try all of the machine learning model types that we have learned about this semester (and others from our own research) and compare the results to determine which one works best for this data. We will also fine tune the parameters for each model to ensure that each performs as best as it can.*  
  
6.  What are your anticipated results?  Do you have a hypothesis?  
  
*We hypothesize that the director/writer of the film will have a strong effect on predicting the metascore. This is because highly-skilled directors are generally able to make successful movies on lower budgets. We also expect that budget plays a strong role in determining the metascore, but we’re interested to see if there is any nuance in this assumption.*  
  
7.  Outline a plan of how everyone in the group is going to participate in this project.  
  
*As we get started on the project, we plan to touch base every week to set goals and keep each other accountable. In our last project together, we decided to split up the tasks by stage of the project. We found that the workload ended up getting a bit imbalanced that way, so this time we plan to all work concurrently on each stage of the project.*  
  
8.  Who's GitHub account are you planning on using to host this project?  
  
*The class github organization*
